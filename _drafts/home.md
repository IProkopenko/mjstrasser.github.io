“Are you glad to be home?”  
 they ask of me  
  after some time living away.  
Of course! Where the heart is.  
 But the city of my birth  
  laid a claim on mine  
   over those five years.  

My curated home was here  
  and will be again  
   when I am again used to it.

“So where is home?”  
  I felt safe to ask after a “back home” comment  
   … being careful of a “where do you come from?” gaffe  


Even if my choices don’t enmesh perfectly  
  …  
  But at least I was free to choose.
