“Are you glad to be home?”  
&nbsp;&nbsp;they ask of me  
&nbsp;&nbsp;after some time living away.  
Of course! Where the heart is.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;But the city of my birth  
&nbsp;&nbsp;laid a claim on mine over those five years.  
After many years of making this one mine.

“So where is home?”  
&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt safe to ask after a “back home” comment  
&nbsp;&nbsp;… being careful of a “where do you come from?” gaffe  


Even if my choices don’t enmesh perfectly  
&nbsp;&nbsp;…  
&nbsp;&nbsp;But at least I was free to choose.
