Today I voted Yes in the Australian [postal survey for marriage
equality](https://marriagesurvey.abs.gov.au/). It was an easy decision, Quite simply,
love is love, this is a matter of fundamental human equality, and the details
of other people’s love for each other is none of my business.

Is it OK to vote “no” as the naysayers’ slogan goes? Of course, because everybody
is free to vote as they choose.

But it is not OK to base your decision on misleading allegations about the ill-effects
on children of same-sex parenting, or curbs on religious freedoms, or fears about
the follow-on effects (and so on). All of these claims have been refuted in a number
of places, if you care to look. Many countries have already accepted marriage
equality and they have survived very well. 

Do the people making dire claims about the effects of marriage equality really
believe the things they say, given their dubious veracity, or is there some
underlying, unexpressed reason? I wonder if they actually find ‘non-standard’
sexuality at least unsettling and probably repulsive.

Perhaps there is a spectrum of views from dislike (I won’t do that) to disgust
(I don’t like to think about that) to disapproval (I don’t want you do that).
Disapproval is a moral judgement about other people’s behaviour. 

And moral judgement invites people to extend their views about what is, and is
not, their business.
