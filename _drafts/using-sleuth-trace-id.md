## Introduction

On a recent project we implemented an API service using [Spring
Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) with two operations:

1. initiate a new, asynchronous workflow
2. report on the status of an existing workflow

Each workflow is identified by a unique ID that is generated by the
service on the first call and returned to the consumer. The consumer then uses
that ID in subsequent status requests to identify the workflow.

### Spring Cloud Sleuth

The service is one of a mesh of microservices and we added [Spring Cloud
Sleuth](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-sleuth/) to provide tracing across microservice calls.
In Sleuth, a **Span** is a basic unit of work, and spans are linked together into a **Trace**
for a single logical transaction.
The [Sleuth Reference](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-sleuth/1.2.1.RELEASE/)
provides much more detail, including this useful diagram:

### Generating a unique ID for each workflow

Instead of generating a new ID (e.g. a UUID) we decided to take the
trace ID from Sleuth. Sleuth generates a random long integer as a trace
ID at the beginning of the request and passes that as part of
synchronous requests to other services. 

Part of the rationale for using the trace ID is to reduce log message clutter.
When Sleuth is included, the IDs are inserted into the Spring logs via
the SLF4J MDC. Here is the start of a Spring Boot log message with Sleuth information:

```text
2017-07-14 13:32:59.094  INFO [api-service,92e9013d25cca084,92e9013d25cca084,false] [10.242.22.52] 25453 ---
```

* **api-service** is the application name
* **92e9013d25cca084** is both trace ID and the span ID (this happens in the first span of a trace)
* (I canâ€™t remember what **false** means)

## Getting the Sleuth trace ID

Getting the trace ID turned out to be very simple. We created a Spring service
called `Breadcrumb` to return the formatted trace ID.

```java
package com.example;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import org.springframework.cloud.sleuth.Tracer;

@Service
public class Breadcrumb {

  @Autowired
  private Tracer tracer;

  public String breadcrumbId() {
    return tracer.getCurrentSpan().traceIdString();
  }
}
```

`Span#traceIdString()` returns the trace ID
in the same hexadecimal format used in the log messages.

The controller that handles the HTTP POST to start the workflow injects
this service and calls `breadcrumb.getBreadcrumb()` to get the current
trace ID string.
