Today I voted Yes in the Australian [postal survey for marriage
equality](https://marriagesurvey.abs.gov.au/). It was an easy decision: quite simply,
love is love, this is a matter of fundamental human equality, and the details
of other people’s love for each other is none of my business.

There have been some ugly comments made by marriage equality advocates about those
recommending a No vote. These kinds of things are unnecessary and are potentially
damaging to the cause for Yes. But there must be a sense of proportion: these
are minuscule in number compared to the widespread occurrence of bullying
and other mistreatment of LGBTI people throughout their lives.

Is it OK to vote “no” as the naysayers’ slogan goes? Of course, because everybody
is free to vote as they choose.

But it is not OK to base your decision on misleading allegations about the ill-effects
on children of same-sex parenting, or curbs on religious freedoms, or fears about
the follow-on effects (and so on). All of these claims have been refuted in a number
of places, if you care to look. Many countries have already accepted marriage
equality and they have survived very well. 

Do the people making dire claims about the effects of marriage equality really
believe the things they say, given their dubious veracity, or is there some
underlying, unexpressed reason? I wonder if they actually find non-binary sexuality
unsettling at least and probably repulsive.

Perhaps there is a scale from dislike (I won’t do that) to disgust (I don’t
like to think about that) to disapproval (I don’t want you do that). Disapproval 
is a moral position because it affects how we see other
people’s behaviour. 

This kind of moral position invites people to be concerned about other people’s
business, whether they should or not.
