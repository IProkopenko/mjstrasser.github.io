I have resuscitated a blog after about 10 yearsâ€™ absence. As in that previous
life, it is called *Relatively Ignorant* and contains bits and pieces of things
I have observed at work and elsewhere.

This incarnation is
[hosted at GitHub](https://github.com/mjstrasser/mjstrasser.github.io)
and is produced using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the
[Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) theme.
Thanks to my [ThoughtWorks](https://thoughtworks.com/) colleague
[Matt Newman](https://mdjnewman.me/) for providing a model of the simple
kind of blog I wanted.

It also uses HTTPS exclusively so I feel all grown up now.
