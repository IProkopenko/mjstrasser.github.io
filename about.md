# Relatively Ignorant

I am Michael Strasser and this blog is the place I choose to capture
some fragments of knowledge about things.

I am a software developer at [ThoughtWorks](https://thoughtworks.com/)
in Melbourne, Australia. In my other lives I am an experienced singer
of ‘classical’ music, currently in choirs, a husband, father, occasional
cyclist & golfer.
